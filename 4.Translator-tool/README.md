# ðŸ§¬ Translator Tool

This folder contains Python scripts for DNA/RNA to protein translation as part of my bioinformatics practice and assignments.  
The scripts cover both simple translation and reading frame analysis.

simple_translator.py -> Direct translation of sequence (1 frame only, no ORFs)

Reading_frame_translator.py -> Identifies ORF
